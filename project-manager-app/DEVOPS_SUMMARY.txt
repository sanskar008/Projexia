DevOps Improvements Summary for Project Manager App
==================================================

1. Automated Testing & CI
------------------------
- Installed Jest and Supertest for backend API testing.
- Created an example test file in `server/tests/auth.test.js`.
- Added a `test` script to `server/package.json`.
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for CI at `.github/workflows/test.yml` to run tests on every push and pull request.

2. Error Monitoring
-------------------
- Integrated Sentry for backend (Node.js) and frontend (React).
- Sentry initialized in backend (`server/index.js`) and frontend (`src/main.tsx`).
- Added `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` to `.env` for frontend and `SENTRY_DSN` for backend (set your actual DSN values).

3. Backend Security
-------------------
- Added Helmet middleware for HTTP header security.
- Added express-rate-limit to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Added input validation and sanitization using express-validator in backend auth routes.

4. Structured Logging
---------------------
- Set up Winston logger in backend (`server/logger.js`).
- All requests and important events are logged.

5. Performance & Bundle Analysis
-------------------------------
- Installed `source-map-explorer` for frontend bundle analysis.
- To analyze bundle: build frontend and run `npx source-map-explorer dist/assets/index-*.js`.

6. Containerization
-------------------
- Added a `Dockerfile` for backend to enable containerized deployments.

7. Uptime Monitoring (Manual Step)
----------------------------------
- Recommended adding your backend URL to UptimeRobot for downtime alerts (done via their website).

8. Additional Recommendations
-----------------------------
- Expand backend and frontend tests for better coverage.
- Use Sentry dashboards to monitor errors in production.
- Regularly review and update dependencies to reduce vulnerabilities.
