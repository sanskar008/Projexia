## About Projexia

In today's fast-paced environment, effective project management is crucial for success. Projexia aims to simplify this process by offering a centralized platform where teams can organize tasks, communicate effectively, and gain clear insights into project statuses. Whether you're a small startup or a large enterprise, Projexia adapts to your workflow, helping you maintain clarity, accountability, and momentum.

## Features

Projexia comes packed with powerful features to enhance your project management experience:

-   **Task Tracking**: Create, assign, prioritize, and track the status of individual tasks within any project. Supports custom task statuses and due dates.
-   **Team Collaboration**: Facilitate real-time communication and collaboration among team members. Share updates, comments, and files directly within tasks and projects.
-   **Interactive Dashboard**: Get a high-level overview of all ongoing projects, critical deadlines, assigned tasks, and team workload through an intuitive and customizable dashboard.
-   **Progress Monitoring**: Easily monitor the progress of tasks and projects with visual indicators and reporting tools, helping identify bottlenecks and ensure timely delivery.
-   **User Management**: Manage team members, roles, and permissions to control access and responsibilities within projects.
-   **Notifications**: Stay informed with real-time notifications for task updates, comments, assignments, and deadlines.

## Technology Stack

Projexia is built with modern web technologies to ensure a scalable, maintainable, and responsive application:

-   **Frontend**:
    *   **TypeScript**: Primary programming language for type-safe and scalable code.
    *   **React**: A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    *   **State Management**: (e.g., React Context API or Redux/Zustand) for predictable state management.
    *   **Styling**: (e.g., CSS Modules / Styled Components / Tailwind CSS) for modular and efficient styling.
-   **Build Tools**:
    *   **Vite / Webpack**: For bundling and optimizing the application.
    *   **npm / Yarn**: Package managers for managing dependencies.

*(Note: While the primary language is TypeScript, the application leverages JavaScript libraries and frameworks extensively.)*

## Installation

To get Projexia up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sanskar008/Projexia.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the application directory**:
    The main application code resides in the `project-manager-app` directory.
    ```bash
    cd Projexia/project-manager-app
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server**:
    This will compile the TypeScript code and launch the application in development mode, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    The application should now be running in your browser.

5.  **Build for production (Optional)**:
    To create an optimized production build of the application:
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```
    This will generate a `dist` or `build` folder containing the compiled and optimized static assets, ready for deployment.

## Usage

Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port indicated in your console).

Hereâ€™s a brief guide on how to get started:

1.  **Sign Up / Log In**: If authentication is implemented, create a new account or log in with existing credentials.
2.  **Create a New Project**:
    *   Navigate to the "Projects" section.
    *   Click on the "New Project" button.
    *   Enter project details like name, description, and start/end dates.
3.  **Add Tasks**:
    *   Inside a project, go to the "Tasks" tab.
    *   Click "Add Task", provide a title, description, assignees, due date, and priority.
4.  **Invite Team Members**:
    *   From the project settings or a dedicated "Team" section, invite collaborators using their email addresses.
    *   Assign appropriate roles (e.g., Admin, Member, Viewer).
5.  **Monitor Progress**:
    *   Use the "Dashboard" to see an overview of all projects and their statuses.
    *   Within individual projects, track task completion and overall project progress.

## Core Modules

The `project-manager-app` directory is structured to separate concerns and facilitate maintainability. Key modules and their responsibilities include:

-   `src/components`: Reusable UI components (e.g., `Button`, `Modal`, `TaskCard`).
-   `src/pages`: Top-level components representing different views/pages of the application (e.g., `DashboardPage`, `ProjectDetailsPage`, `TasksPage`).
-   `src/services`: Handles API calls and data fetching logic (e.g., `projectService.ts`, `taskService.ts`).
-   `src/utils`: Utility functions and helpers (e.g., date formatting, validation).
-   `src/types`: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces for data structures.
-   `src/context` / `src/store`: (If applicable) Global state management setup.

Example of a typical service call (conceptual):

```typescript
// src/services/projectService.ts
import api from './api'; // Assuming an Axios or Fetch wrapper

export interface Project {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'on-hold';
  // ... other project properties
}

export const projectService = {
  async getAllProjects(): Promise<Project[]> {
    const response = await api.get<Project[]>('/projects');
    return response.data;
  },

  async createProject(projectData: Omit<Project, 'id'>): Promise<Project> {
    const response = await api.post<Project>('/projects', projectData);
    return response.data;
  },

  // ... other CRUD operations
};
```
